% Use the following line _only_ if you're still using LaTeX 2.09.
%\documentstyle[icml2015,epsf,natbib]{article}
% If you rely on Latex2e packages, like most moden people use this:
\documentclass{article}

% use Times
\usepackage{times}
% For figures
\usepackage{graphicx} % more modern
%\usepackage{epsfig} % less modern
\usepackage{subfigure} 

% For citations
\usepackage{natbib}

% For algorithms
\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage{algorithmic}

% As of 2011, we use the hyperref package to produce hyperlinks in the
% resulting PDF.  If this breaks your system, please commend out the
% following usepackage line and replace \usepackage{icml2015} with
% \usepackage[nohyperref]{icml2015} above.
\usepackage{hyperref}

% Packages hyperref and algorithmic misbehave sometimes.  We can fix
% this with the following command.
\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}

% Employ the following version of the ``usepackage'' statement for
% submitting the draft version of the paper for review.  This will set
% the note in the first column to ``Under review.  Do not distribute.''
%\usepackage{icml2015} 

% Employ this version of the ``usepackage'' statement after the paper has
% been accepted, when creating the final version.  This will set the
% note in the first column to ``Proceedings of the...''
\usepackage[accepted]{icml2015}


% The \icmltitle you define below is probably too long as a header.

% It is OKAY to include author information, even for blind

Statistical language models are powerful tools which have been used for many tasks within natural language processing.
Recently, they have been used for other sequential data such as source code. \cite{ray2015naturalness}

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was
% created by Lise Getoor and Tobias Scheffer, it was slightly modified  
% from the 2010 version by Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, 
% slightly modified from the 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and 
% Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is slightly modified from 
% Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a lightly 
% changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew Moore, 
% which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and 
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
